        <p class="para-text">Hello! I am Shashwat Mohapatra, a young budding wildlife enthusiast and photographer. I love travelling. So have been visiting various places trying to capture their beauty and essence with my camera.
            
            It all started at a very young age when I used to love visiting zoos to observe the animals there. It was like a weekend ritual for me and my dad. But as I grew up , I began hating zoos because I couldn’t see animals in captivity, So I started venturing into the forests to search for wildlife around us. My love for wildlife developed immensely. My uncle was into photography and he taught me photography wherever we went with our camera.  Then in 2010  I got one small Canon point and shoot camera from my dad.
            
            So I got passionate about photography and wildlife which was largely restricted to mammals. But it was in 2014, during my school trip to the Little Rann of Kutch , that my senior introduced me to the avian world . He showed me the book – “Birds of the Indian subcontinent” by Richard Grimmett  which just blew my mind. The variety of birds in that book got me hooked on to birds . I was curious to know more about the Class Aves .
            
            I spotted my first bird on the trip – a green bee eater which was so shiny and beautiful. Soon after the trip , I bought the same book and another one “Birds of India”  by Dr. Salim Ali as I was  enchanted by the avian world. So this was the beginning of my adventure into the wild – from loving wildlife to capturing wildlife. It’s not just wildlife but overall Nature and the environment that excite me.</p>
